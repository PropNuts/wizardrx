# wizardrx

This repository contains the hardware and firmware for the PropNuts WizardRX, a
6-way 5.8GHz video receiver. It can be easily hand-soldered using cheap parts
found online, costing roughly £60-70.

Channels can be set through a three-button interface, with an OLED display for
feedback.

## Motiviation

We wanted to be able to view video feeds at our race events. Buying six
standalone receivers cost too much (roughly £120 or more, double that if you
want diversity) and take up too much space. This seemed like a better way
forward.


## Status

The first boards have been ordered and have not yet arrived, so all of this is
currently __untested__. Proceed at your own risk!

Work on the firmware will start once the first board is put together.


# Hardware

The KiCad files can be found under `hardware/`.

## Parts List

# Firmware

The firmware is yet to be developed.
